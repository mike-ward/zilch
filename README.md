# zilch

An entertaining and amusing simulation of an installer.

## Description

**zilch** is a playful project that simulates the experience of running an installer, but in reality, it doesn’t actually do anything (“zilch”). It’s designed for humor and entertainment, mimicking installer visuals and progress, but accomplishes nothing under the hood.

## Features

- Simulates the look and feel of a software installer
- Entertaining progress bars and messages
- Does not install or change anything—purely for fun

## Technologies

- Main language: V

## Usage

Since zilch is a simulation, simply run the program to see a fake installation process in action.  
No files are modified, installed, or removed.
